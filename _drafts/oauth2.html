<h2>Backgroud</h2>
<p>
  We are in the middle of implementing <a href="http://oauth.net/2">OAuth 2</a> towards <a href="http://www.schibstedpayment.no">SPiD</a>.
  This means that we have to learn the OAuth2 Protocol. 
  We could have used the basic <a href="https://github.com/schibsted/sdk-java">SPiD Java API</a> but it's not really Scala friendly and it includes a lot of dependencies.
  On the other side we believe that you should understand the basis of the protocols we are using. 
  That being HTTP, OAuth2, SOAP, REST and others.
</p>

<h2>Protocol</h2>
<p>
  There are several different uses of the OAuth2 protocol. 
  We are a server based web application so we focus on that part of the protocol.
</p>

<p>
  There are basically two things that happens in the authentication part of the protocol on our side of the interaction.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>To authentication server - Making the user go the authenication server with an authentication request.</li>
  <li>From authentication server - Handling users that are redirected to us with access information from the authentication server.</li>
</ol>

<h3>To authentication server</h3>
<p>
  In some way we need to get the users client to go to the autentication server with a few parameters in the url.
  We can create a link directly on a webpage to the authentication server with the correct info or we can 
  make an link to our own site that redirects the user to the authentication server with the correct parameters.
  The url should look like:
</p>

<code>
  https://authentication.server/login/path?parameters
</code>

The parameters are:

<dl>
  <dt>client_id</dt>
  <dd>Our client id given to us from the authenication provider when we signed up for being an authentication client.</dd>

  <dt>redirect_uri</dt>
  <dd>
    The URL in our application where users will be sent to after the authentication. 
    That means step 2: From the authentication server which we will describe later.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>scope</dt>
  <dd>
    The amount of info we want access after user in authorized. Is only handled the first time the user authorizes us.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>state</dt>
  <dd>
    Random string to prevent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a> attacks. This is not a part of the SPiD implementation but we have added it to the redirect_uri.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>From authentication server</h3>

<p>
  After the user has logged in and authorized us he or she is redirected back to us on the redirect URL specified in the to authentication server. 
  The url contains these parameters:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd></dd>

</dl>

=> failure and cancel

This information is used to ask the authentication server for all mighty authentication token which can be used to get access to services/endpoints on behalf of the user. 
We ask the authentication server if we can get an access token with this request:

<code>
  https://authentication.server/authenticate/path?parameters
</code>

With these parameters:

<dl>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd></dd>

</dl>

The server can respond with success or failure.
